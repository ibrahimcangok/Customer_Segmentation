This project aims to analyze customer data from an e-commerce database to perform customer segmentation, identifying different customer groups and developing tailored strategies for each segment. The process involves data loading and preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, and customer segmentation using the K-Means algorithm. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow method, and the segments were evaluated for business value. The results enable personalized marketing, efficient use of resources, and strategic decision-making, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and increasing sales. Future work includes dynamic segmentation updates, data enrichment, and advanced machine learning models for improved segmentation.
